## AN INTRODUCTION TO PROCESSING

Make: Getting Started with Processing by Ben Fry and Casey Reas (2nd Edition, 2015) 
[Amazon (~$17)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1457187086)

Alternatively, the book is available digitally on [O'Reilly Safari](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920031406.do)

### DOWNLOAD PROCESSING AND RUN YOUR FIRST APPLICATION

As students, you won't be required to purchase Processing (if you start to use it professionally, I’d encourage you to donate time or $ to the Processing Foundation). Processing runs on Windows and Linux; however, I’ll be teaching the workshops on a Mac (so if you have access to a Mac laptop, it will probably make it easier to follow along in class).

[Processing: Getting Started](https://processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted/)

If you're brand new to processing, or it's been a little while since you've written code, check out Daniel Shiffman's fantastic one hour tutorial and introduction to processing: [Hello Processing](http://hello.processing.org)

Daniel Shiffman's Video Tutorials on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VLaIr5Ckbs) are also an excellent place to start.
